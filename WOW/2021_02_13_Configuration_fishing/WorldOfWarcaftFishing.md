Welcome to you. 

Open Macro Input is a software that trigger macro based on the input you want.
The following files allows you to listen to the sound of your computer as a trigger to macro that will recover and cast a fish for you.

## Introduction
In World of Warcaft there is something boring like hell that nobody want to do.
Fishing ! 

Some like/love it... most hate it.  

That why fishing are so hight in price on the auction hourse.  

What is unfair is that people like me don't want to fish all day and create bot to farm it.  
That good for those who don't like it but that unfaire for those not using bot.  

So what I did is to provide to you here the file to have your own farming bot.  
The software is totaly free and will stay free. So enjoy your bot.
